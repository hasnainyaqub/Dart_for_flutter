## Dart Comments Syntax

Dart supports three types of comments:

### 1) Single-Line Comment
Use `//` for single-line comments:
```dart
// This is a single-line comment
print('Hello Dart');

### 2) Multi-Line Comment

Use /* */ for multi-line or block comments:

/*
 This is a multi-line comment.
 It can span multiple lines.
*/
print('Hello Dart');
